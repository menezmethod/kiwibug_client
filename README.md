## Introduction
After juggling multiple projects in my personal and professional life, I decided to create an app that I could not only use to showcase some of the latest technologies I'd been working with, but also use myself. This is a simple issue tracking system that you could use to keep track of issues in your projects.

This project's goal is to be scalable and to serve as a practice tool for real-world application development. Feel free to explore the code in this repository.
